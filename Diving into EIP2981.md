# Diving into EIP-2981

**The problem**

Several NFTs are resold many times across diferrent platforms without the mean to easily and consistently transfer the royalty information. 

This led to the proposal of EIP-2981.

### üëë What is EIP-2981? 

"A standardized way to retrieve royalty payment information for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enable universal support for royalty payments across all NFT marketplaces and ecosystem participants."<sup>1</sup>
     
In short, 

### üèóÔ∏è What can be built with it

EIP-2981 is a universal royalty standard and is not limited to the implementation of ERC-721 and ERC-1155 alone. As long as a contract is compatible with the constraints of EIP-2981, it can use this standard to retrieve royalty payment information.  

### üßë‚Äçüç≥ A Demo & Walk-through

Github repo with code example
    
**Summary: The value of EIP-2981**

Without an agreement on the way to share royalty information acroos platforms, it makes colleting ongoing funding hard for artist and creators and therefore, 

Providing NFT marketplaces with a single universal royalty payment standard not only make it easier for artists and creators, but also benefit the entire NFT ecosystem.
